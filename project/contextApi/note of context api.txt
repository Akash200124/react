1.what is context API  (only exist in react) similar Redux is also use to management of the states 

const SomeContext = createContext(defaultValue)

Redux library in react -> react-Redux or other place Redux-toolkit (RTK) 

zustand - it is also a state management library 

it is use to share the value in components like language , username and password dark mode  (it is like prop ) 

2. To send the prop to the component inside the component like <Dashboard name= " ">  <name= " " card> <Dashboard/> we have to write the name in all the component and this is call the prop drilling that is not optimized way 

to deal with this problem we use the context API where we make a glable component that is directory call in any component
